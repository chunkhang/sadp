### [Architectural Pattern](#)
- Establishes a relation between
   1. [**Context**](#)
      - A **recurring**, common situation in the world that gives rise to a problem
   2. [**Problem**](#)
      - The problem arising in the given context that is appropriately **generalised**
   3. [**Solution**](#)
      - A successful architectural resolution to the problem that is appropriately **abstracted**
      - Determined and **described** by
         - A set of **element** types (e.g. objects and processes)
         - A set of **interaction** mechanism or connectors (e.g. method calls and events)
         - A topological **layout** of components
         - A set of semantic **constraints**
